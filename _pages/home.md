## About Me  

I am a bioinformatics researcher specializing in genomic analysis, epigenomics, and deep learning–based biological data modeling.  
My research focuses on building computational models that uncover regulatory patterns in high-dimensional biological signals.

Previously, I worked as a **Bioinformatics Analysis Specialist at NGeneBio Inc.**, performing clinical NGS QC, variant interpretation, reporting, and database curation.  
Through real-world industry experience and my ongoing M.Sc. research on **EpiCon-Former**, I have developed strong expertise in **AI-driven clinical genomics**.
