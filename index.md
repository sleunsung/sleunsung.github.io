## About me
I am a bioinformatics researcher interested in genomics, epigenomics, and deep learning–based biological data analysis.  
My research focuses on building computational models that uncover regulatory patterns in high-dimensional biological signals.

I am currently completing my M.Sc. in Bioinformatics at Soongsil University, where I developed **EpiCon-Former**,  
a contrastive Transformer framework for epigenomic representation learning.
