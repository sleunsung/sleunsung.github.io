##  Welcome

I am a bioinformatics researcher interested in genomics, epigenomics, and deep learning–based biological data analysis. My research focuses on computational models that uncover regulatory patterns in high-dimensional biological signals.  
Currently, I am completing my M.Sc. in Bioinformatics at Soongsil University, where I developed **EpiCon-Former**, a contrastive Transformer framework for epigenomic representation learning.
